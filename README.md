# DJBuy

A bookmarklet that helps facilitate song chart purchases from the DJMAX Technika 3 [website][1].

Buying charts is a simple but tedious task.  It takes too many clicks and way more time than it should.  DJBuy helps by reducing the number of clicks required and bypassing pointless page redirects, making the entire process lightning fast.

## Installation

- Create a new bookmark.  You may call it whatever you like.
- Copy and paste the code found [here][2] as the URL of the bookmark.


## Usage

Navigate to a song with charts you wish to purchase then click the newly created bookmark.  You'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you wish to proceed.  Agree, and DJBuy will automatically purchase all charts for you.  It'll then return you to the previous page.

Note: DJBuy will only work in the Max Point Shop for Star and Pop Mixing charts.
