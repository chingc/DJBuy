# DJBuy

A bookmarklet to facilitate purchases from the DJMAX Technika 3 Max Point Shop.

Buying items is a simple but tedious task.  It takes too many clicks and way more time than it should.  DJBuy is designed to purchase all charts of a song with a single click, avoiding extra clicking and page redirects.

Introduced in DJBuy 1.4 is the ability to purchase an entire page of icons, plates, or titles at a time!

1. Create a new browser bookmark.  You may call it whatever you like.
2. Copy and paste the code found [here][download] as the URL of the bookmark.


## Usage

Navigate to a song with charts you wish to purchase then click the newly created bookmark.  You will be presented with a dialog box asking if you wish to proceed.  Agree, and DJBuy will automatically purchase all charts for you.  It will then return you to the previous page.
