# DJBuy

Buying items from the [DJMAX](http://www.djmaxcrew.com/) Technika 3 Max Point Shop is a simple but tedious task.  It takes too many clicks and more time than it should.

DJBuy is a bookmarklet designed to purchase all charts of a song with a single click, saving you lots of unnecessary clicks and page redirects.  Purchasing an entire page of icons, plates, or titles at a time is also supported.

## End of Life

Official support for DJMAX Technika 3 ended on December 31, 2013.  The online service and website are no longer available.  As a result, there will be no further updates or releases of DJBuy.

## Installation

Simply create a new browser bookmark and paste this [code](./djbuy.min.js) as its URL.

## Usage

Navigate to a song with charts you wish to purchase then click the newly created bookmark.  You will be presented with a dialog box asking if you wish to proceed.  [[Screenshot]](./djbuy_01.png)

Agree, and DJBuy will automatically purchase all charts for you.  It will then return you to the previous page.  [[Screenshot]](./djbuy_02.png)

DJBuy will let you know if there is nothing to buy.  [[Screenshot]](./djbuy_03.png)
